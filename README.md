# Robotic_Hand
Code for a 3D printed hand which mimics the finger movement of the user using flex sensors &amp; servos:


The gesture-controlled robotic hand mimics the finger movements of my own hand, when wearing a special glove. 
The glove contains “flex” sensors and other electrical circuitry, so that any finger movements could be 
detected by the sensors and relayed to the 3D-printed robotic hand. This is based off of the concept of a voltage divide, 
where the voltage is divided acros two resistors (flex sensors on the glove) and the voltage read by the arduino would be a fraction
of the original input voltage based on the bend of the flex sensor.  This voltage is relayed as a signal to the robotic arm through wired connections to control motors on the robot arm.  These could in the future be replaced by wireless connections.
